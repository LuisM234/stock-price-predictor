## Stock Price Predictor

This project was built to help my understanding of how machine learning models can be applied to financial data.  
I learnt key concepts like data preprocessing, model training, and visualization.

**Next steps:** I'm experimenting with creating notebooks on Kaggle and here on Github to progress further on my journey in learning data science and machine learning.
