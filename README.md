## Stock Price Predictor

This project was built by following a YouTube tutorial to understand how machine learning models can be applied to financial data.  
I followed along to learn key concepts like data preprocessing, model training, and visualization.

**Original tutorial:** [[link to the tutorial] ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ50ew8wi-0&t=1s) 
**Next steps:** I'm experimenting with creating notebooks on Kaggle and here on Github to progress further on my journey in learning data science and machine learning.
